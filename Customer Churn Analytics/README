Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service.

One sector in which knowing and predicting cancellation rates is particularly useful is the telecommunications sector, because most customers have several options to choose from within a geographic location.

In this project, I predicted the customer churn using a free IBM Sample Data Sets Portal telecommunications data set. I used logistic regression, decision tree and random forest as Machine Learning models.
